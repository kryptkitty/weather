# `weather`

A nix flake for showing the weather.

Also a nix flake for showing how to make a shell script into nix flake that can be run directly.

Also a nix flake that makes a templated version of itself.

## Usage

After [configuring your nix install to work with flakes][EnableFlakes]:

```bash
nix run github:kryptkitty/weather#
```

or

```bash
nix run github:kryptkitty/weather#weather
```

or, if you don't have nix and don't know if you want it yet, here's a docker command that will do the same

```bash
docker run -ti nixos/nix nix run github:kryptkitty/weather# --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
```

## Template

To make a new flake based off of this one, use nix flake init with this flake as the template:

```bash
nix flake init -t github:kryptkitty/weather
```

Then follow the directions!  You will be asked to run a setup script which will initialize the
flake's template data.  This will be described in the template's welcomeText so give it a whirl.

### Template Maintenance

The template update system consists of a shell script in `bin/` called
`update-template.sh`.  This script will clone all the files except for a
handful that would be inappropriate into `template/`.  The files which are not
copied are the existing flake's `.git/`, `flake.lock`, `template/`,
`update-template.sh` and `*.template`.  Most of those make sense except for
`*.template` which is explained below.

#### Template-only files

Any files which exist _only_ in `template/` will remain there after running
`update-template.sh`.  This is used to present files only to a template rather
than to the example weather flake.

#### `*.template` overrides

This class of file is special because it will override its unadorned sibling.
This can be seen in `README.md` which has a sibling `README.md.template` to use
instead of the template flake's `README.md` which you are reading now.

Any file may be used this way but the file to override must exist next to the
`.template` version.  If there is no base file, the template file will not be
found.

#### `init-template.sh` generation

This autogenerated file exists only in `template/` and will be replaced upon
every invocation of `update-template.sh`.

To make permanent changes to this file, the changes must be made in
`update-template.sh` near the end.

### Template Workflow

NOTE: in this section, `.` is the folder that holds `.git` for
`github:kryptkitty/weather`:

1) make desired changes
  * changes to `./template/init-template.sh` go in `./bin/update-template.sh`
  * changes to `./template/README.md` go in `./README.md.template`
  * changes to other files go into the respective file in `.`, (e.g., changes
    to `./template/flake.nix` go into `./flake.nix`)

2) run `update-template.sh`
  * take changes from the described places and bundle them up in template
  * convert constants such as the author's name into `@VARIABLES@` in all files
    within `./template/`.  This is used, for example, to create the copyright line
    in `./template/LICENSE` out of the same copyright line in `./LICENSE`

3) run `git add .`
  * this step is a must because of how flakes work.

4) test
  * there is no automated testing for this yet.  Feel free to contribute it.
    for now, here is my method:
    * ```bash
      cd "$HOME/src/github.com/kryptkitty"
      rm -rf testing-weather-template
      mkdir testing-weather-template
      cd testing-weather-template
      nix flake init -t ../weather
      bash init-template.sh
      # follow prompts
      nix run .#
      ```
  * Remember to spot check the files.  This is easily done at this stage (git it?  staged commit pun) using git:
    * ```bash
      git diff --cached
      ```

5) commit and push
  * there is currently no formal release process for this project.
